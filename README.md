# GPT-5 and Codex Testing Project

This repository began as a test bed for two AI coding assistants: first GPT-5, then Codex. The initial files were created with GPT-5. When the canvas reached its limit, work continued with Codex to explore how well it could edit the files, add new features, and fix bugs. Every file in this project, including this README, was written by AI.

## The Game

The project is a small 3D game experiment. GPT-5 was prompted with the following request:

> create a interactable 3d world with controls like running and jumping. Put everything in a single html file.

From this prompt, GPT-5 produced a basic world rendered through the browser, and Codex later helped refactor and organize the files.

Recent updates expand the terrain system with rivers, lakes, and oceans for a more lifelike landscape.

## Purpose

The repository demonstrates, in an approachable way, what it looks like to build a small website with AI assistance. Rather than diving into deep technical detail, it showcases the process of:

- starting a simple code base from scratch
- iteratively refining it through conversational prompts
- evaluating how each AI handles modifications and debugging

## What's in the repository

- `index.html` – the original single-file game scaffold from GPT-5
- `css/` – styling for the page
- `js/` – scripts used to add interactivity

## Looking ahead

As the experiment continues, the repository may grow with more examples, refinements, and lessons learned about collaborating with AI on coding tasks.
