# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project hosts an interactive 3D world rendered directly in the browser. It began as a single-file experiment generated by AI and evolved into a small game prototype with adjustable terrain, movement settings and builder tools.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click **Start** to lock the pointer and enter the world.
3. Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move, `Space` to jump and `Shift` to run.

## Directory Structure
- `index.html` – page layout and module loader.
- `css/` – interface styling.
- `js/` – game logic and utilities.
  - `core/` – shared helpers such as noise generation.
  - `player/` – movement and physics.
  - `world/` – terrain generation and chunk management.
  - `builder/` – tools for spawning blocks.

## Code Overview

### Core modules
- `environment.js` sets up the Three.js scene, camera and renderer used by the rest of the code.
- `state.js` stores reactive settings like the world seed and flags for debug features.
- `terrain.js` exposes the `heightAt` function that combines multiple noise layers to shape the ground.

### World generation
- `world.js` holds scene groups for terrain and utilities for adding or removing meshes.
- `procgen.js` lazily populates the world with decorative blocks. It divides the plane into chunks and loads or unloads them based on distance from the player. Chunk contents are seeded so the same seed always produces identical geometry.
- `controls.js` binds UI elements to world options such as seed, mountain amplitude and procedural toggle.

### Player logic
- `player/controls.js` listens for pointer lock and mouse movement to rotate the camera.
- `player/movement` contains keyboard input handlers and simple physics to walk, jump and run.

### Builder tools
- `builder/index.js` enables block placement mode when the **B** key is pressed and drops cubes into the world at the aimed location.

### Miscellaneous
- `ui.js` drives the start menu and displays debug panels.
- `debug.js` exposes helpers on `window.__DEBUG` to selectively disable features.

## Development Notes
The project avoids build steps and external package managers. All assets load directly in the browser via ES modules and CDN links.
